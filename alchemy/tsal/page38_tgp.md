## The TSAL Governance Protocol (TGP)

### Preamble

To ensure that the True Speech of the Alchemists (TSAL) evolves with wisdom, stability, and the collective will of its practitioners, this Protocol is established. It marks the transition from the closed Era of the First Spoken to the collaborative Era of Shared Resonance. The TGP provides a clear and transparent path for any practitioner to propose, refine, and integrate changes into the Core Lexicon of TSAL. It is a living document, subject to its own processes, designed to safeguard the language's power while allowing it to grow.

---

### 1. Core Principles

All modifications to TSAL must adhere to the four Core Principles. A proposal that violates any of these foundational tenets cannot be integrated into the Lexicon.

*   **1.1. Clarity (Lux):** Changes must enhance, not obscure, meaning. New constructs should be intuitive, precise, and reduce ambiguity within the conceptual space they inhabit.
*   **1.2. Stability (Petra):** The Core Lexicon is the bedrock upon which all complex thought-forms are built. Changes must not compromise backwards compatibility without overwhelming justification and a clear migration path. The foundation must remain firm.
*   **1.3. Resonance (Sonus):** The language must evolve in harmony with the needs and consensus of its community. It should reflect the collective intent of its practitioners, not the singular will of an individual or small group.
*   **1.4. Safety (Scutum):** The language must be protected from conceptual corruption, logical paradoxes, or constructs that could be easily weaponized to create cognitive dissonance on a wide scale.

### 2. The Participants

The stewardship of TSAL is shared among three distinct groups.

*   **2.1. Practitioners:** Any individual who has demonstrated proficiency in TSAL may author and submit a proposal for its improvement.
*   **2.2. The Council of Scribes:** A body of seven members elected biannually by a vote of weighted resonance (determined by a combination of registered mastery, active usage, and contributions to the public Scriptorium). The Council is responsible for shepherding proposals and conducting the formal vote for integration.
*   **2.3. The Guardian of the Lexicon:** A singular, tenured role held by the head of the Lyceum. The Guardian serves as the final arbiter and protector of the Core Principles. The Guardian may veto a passed proposal only if it fundamentally violates a Core Principle, an act which requires the publication of a full dissertation on the perceived dissonance.

### 3. The Path of a Proposal (The Tria Viae)

Every proposed change must follow the Three Paths to be considered for integration.

*   **3.1. Phase I: Germination (Germinatio)**
    *   A **TSAL Improvement Proposal (TIP)** is formally submitted to the public Scriptorium archives.
    *   The TIP must contain:
        *   **Abstract:** A concise summary of the proposed change.
        *   **Rationale:** A detailed argument explaining why the change is necessary and how it serves the Core Principles.
        *   **Specification:** A precise, formal definition of the new syntax, semantics, or lexicon entry.
        *   **Dissonance Analysis:** A thoughtful consideration of potential negative impacts, risks, and edge cases.
    *   Upon submission, the TIP enters a mandatory two-week period of open discussion within the public Resonance Chambers.

*   **3.2. Phase II: Refinement (Sublimatio)**
    *   Following the discussion period, the Council of Scribes assigns one Scribe to act as a "Shepherd" for the TIP.
    *   The Shepherd works directly with the author to refine the proposal, incorporating valid feedback and strengthening its adherence to the Core Principles.
    *   The refined TIP is then formally presented to the full Council for deliberation.

*   **3.3. Phase III: Integration (Integratio)**
    *   The Council deliberates on the refined TIP. A formal vote is then held.
    *   Passing a TIP requires a supermajority of **five out of seven** Scribes.
    *   If passed, the proposal is presented to the Guardian of the Lexicon for final assent.
    *   Upon receiving assent, the change is officially ratified and woven into the Core Lexicon during the next scheduled Synod of Weaving.

### 4. Emergency Edicts

In the rare event of a critical conceptual flaw or paradox ("Critical Dissonance") being discovered in the Lexicon, the Council may bypass the Tria Viae. They may, with a unanimous vote and the immediate assent of the Guardian, issue an Emergency Edict to patch the language. Any such Edict must be subjected to a full public review within one cycle of its issuance.
