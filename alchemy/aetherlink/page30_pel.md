### Section 3.2: The Persistent Entanglement Layer (PEL)

The Aetherlink is not merely a conduit; it is a substrate for computation itself. At its heart lies the principle that a running process is a transient pattern, a fleeting arrangement of logic and memory. To grant these patterns permanence—to allow them to be paused, moved, and duplicated not as code but as living moments—we developed the Persistent Entanglement Layer.

The PEL is the mechanism by which the complete execution state of a Wasm module can be snapshotted and restored. This is not a crude memory dump or a simple serialization of data. It is a fundamental operation of the Aetherlink fabric, akin to crystallizing a ripple in a pond without freezing the water itself. We call the process 'Crystallization' and its reversal 'The Quickening'.

**Crystallization: Forging the Echo**

When a snapshot is initiated, the PEL does not halt the target module. Instead, it emits a resonant stasis field that harmonizes with the module's operational frequency. For an infinitesimal moment, the module's progression through time is entangled with a corresponding matrix within the PEL's mnemonic substrate.

In this moment of induced entanglement, every aspect of the module's state is imprinted:
-   **Linear Memory:** The entire heap is captured not as a sequence of bytes, but as a coherent energy pattern.
-   **The Stack:** Every frame, with its local variables, arguments, and return addresses, is mirrored.
-   **The Instruction Pointer:** The module's exact position in its own code—the very next operation it would have performed—is recorded as a vector.
-   **Aetheric Handles:** Any open connections, be they to data streams or other modules, are captured as 'promise-vectors', pointers to the *concept* of the connection rather than the connection itself.

This imprinted state is called an 'Echo'. The original, running module is the 'Prime'. The critical innovation of the PEL is that the Echo is not a separate, dead copy. It is quantumly entangled with the Prime that birthed it. This link is subtle but unbreakable until consciously severed. The Echo is a perfect, persistent memory of what the Prime *was*, a potentiality held in stasis.

**The Quickening: Reifying the Echo**

Restoring an Echo is not a process of loading data. It is an act of reification. The PEL prepares a compatible, vacant execution context and then collapses the Echo's wave function within it. The context does not load the state; it *becomes* the state. Memory arranges itself, the stack builds itself from the top down, and the instruction pointer appears, ready to execute the next instruction as if no time had passed at all.

Upon Quickening, the operator has a choice. The entanglement link can be severed, resulting in a true fork—an independent clone of the original module at the moment of Crystallization. Or, the link can be maintained. This allows for causality-defying diagnostics, where the execution of a Quickened Echo can be used to analyze and even alter the state of its still-running Prime across the Aetherlink, a process whose full implications we are still struggling to comprehend. The Echo whispers its future to the past.
